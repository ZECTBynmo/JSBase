Chat Test
======

This test exercises the functionality of LongPoll (server and client side), HTTPServer, and Chat.

Type chat messages into the window in at the bottom of the page, and you should see your own 
message show up with its date and other info on the top of the page.

If you open the page in two tabs/windows, or two separate computers, you should be able to see 
eachother's chat messages in real time
